        <p>Welcome to my personal blog, Tumbleweed! My name is Irene Sanchez, and this is my online diary where I will 
            document anything and everything. I’m a 26-year-old just tumbling across the United States! I was born in Celaya, Guanajuato, 
            Mexico, but grew up in Chapel Hill, North Carolina most of my life. I am currently in St. Louis, Missouri, but no matter where I am, 
            I will always consider North Carolina <i>home.</i><br> <br>
            As you get to know me, you’ll learn there is no end to what my interest and hobbies are. I have always had a passion 
            for photography and anything that keeps my creative drive going. I am an outdoor person with the endless need 
            to be outside. My curiosity is continuous. I began traveling the states about 6 years ago 
            with my then boyfriend and haven’t stopped since then. I’ve lived as a local in rural America as well as enjoyed 
            the city life. Because of the experiences I’ve had, it has shaped me to the person I am today, and I would love to 
            share that with you. <br><br>

            <!---------separation icons------ -->
            <p3></p3> <br>

            I hope to inspire and give courage to go out there and enjoy life.<br>
            
        </p>
