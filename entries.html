                <p class="main">The City Museum, one of the best museums I have ever visited, is located in downtown 
                St. Louis, Missouri. I always visit The City Museum everytime I come back in town; it 
                is truly a museum like no other. <br>
                In 1993, Two artists, Bob and Gail Cassilly, purchased a 
                one-hundred year old 10-story, formally a shoe warehouse building. Over the course of multiple 
                years they slowly repurposed many items and added it to the building in a magical way. 
                There is a cave system, multiple slides everywhere, wonderful art, sculptures, quirky 
                things in every corner, and so much more. You could literally get lost there for hours.
                The museum is for all ages, it even has a bar for the adults. It even has a Ferris wheel 
                on top of the roof and a school bus on the corner of the roof and halfway hanging midair. 
                I encourage everyone to visit if you ever find yourself in St. Louis! <br>
                Here is a link to their website:

                <h2>Charlevoix, Michigan</h2>

                <p class="main"> Charlevoix, Michigan is a small, quaint town located on the coast of Lake Michigan.
                    It’s a tourist town, with the summer months being their busy season. They have a 
                    small beach area with a red, picturesque lighthouse. They have sand dunes, 
                    campsites on the coast, and a cute downtown area. The first time I saw Lake 
                    Michigan of off the coast of Charlevoix, it was around the end of winter and 
                    the lake was frozen. It was the first time I saw something like that before. 
                    It’s funny because I used to hate the winter, but living up north really made 
                    me appreciate the colder weather.

                <p class="main"> Mackinac Island, a 4.35 sq mile island, is quite a unique experience. It is located in Lake Huron, 
                    right under the UP (upper peninsula). A 10 minute ferry ride is the only way to and from the island. 
                    On the way there you'll come across one of my favorite lighthouses, it's so picture perfect.
                    I’ve probably gone to the island 15 times, that’s how much I love it! <br>

                    What makes this island so special is the ban of all motor vehicles, with the exception of 
                    emergency vehicles. Everyone gets around with bicycles or horse carriages. It truly brings you 
                    back in time; it's quite magical. <br>
                    
                    Mackinac Island has the only “Motorless State Highway,” M-185 goes around the whole island; 
                    it is about 8 miles long, and I’m sad to say I haven’t made it all the way around. It is my 
                    goal to go back and complete all eight miles!<br> 
                    
                    You’d be surprised how much there is to see and explore in such a small island, but I still 
                    feel like I haven’t seen it all. There is a downtown area with shops and restaurants, 
                    there’s historical buildings, biking trails, a limestone Arch Rock formation, and much more. And if you’ve 
                    never seen any of the great lakes before, yes, the water looks like that in person! the water 
                    is incredibly clear and blue! Now imagine being surrounded by beautiful water everywhere you turn. <br>
                    Because of the island, my love for bicycles was born.<br>
